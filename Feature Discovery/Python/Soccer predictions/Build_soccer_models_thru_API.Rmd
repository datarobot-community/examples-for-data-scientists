# Background
In this notebook, we gather and prepare the soccer data for DataRobot's AutoML tool. We queue the model building projects in the notebook (here)[https://github.com/datarobot-community/examples-for-data-scientists/blob/afd_soccer_example_wip/Feature%20Discovery/Python/Soccer%20predictions/Gather_and_prepare_data_for_AFD_soccer_example.Rmd]. 

## Introduction
Automated Feature Discovery (AFD) is a tool offered in DataRobot's Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) portion of the platform. Put simply, AFD helps to derive
hundreds or thousands of features (predictor variables) based on historical information. When it comes to predicting the performance of individuals and teams--
whether they be soccer players or data scientists--understanding their past performance is often the best predictor of future success. How many goals did they
average over the last month? Year? Career? These are the types of features that will lead to good predictions of the number of goals they'll score or points the
team will earn in coming matches. 

In this example, we'll predict the number of goals scored in future games by both the home and away team. This will require two models, home and away, and we will
use a simple assumption that goal scoring follows a Poisson distribution. The advantage to this approach is that we can predict and simulate both the mean goal
totals and the win/loss/draw outcome of the match using the fact that Poisson variance is equal to a Poisson mean. When simulating the remaining MLS regular season
schedule, we need the goal scoring totals to help break ties in the standings for playoff seeding. 

We'll use publicly available data from (American Soccer Analysis)[https://app.americansocceranalysis.com] and DataRobot's AutoML with AFD to train the models.

## Import libraries
```{python load_libraries}
import datarobot as dr
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from dask import delayed, compute
```

# Set up project(s)
## Connect to DataRobot
```{python connect_to_DR}
dr.Client(token = "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
          endpoint = "YOUR_URL_ENDPOINT")
```
## Load primary dataset
The primary dataset includes the home and away teams, and the number of goals they scored in each historical match. Goals scored will be our "target" variable, so
that we can predict goals scored in the future. A key feature of this dataset is the date of the match, so that DataRobot's Automated Feature Discovery knows to
aggregate historical "look-back" features up to, but not including, that date. 
```{python load_datasets}
primary_table = pd.read_csv("Data/team_results_primary.csv")
```

## Register secondary datasets
We load the same dataset four times because we are going to instruct AFD join it four times. For both teams in any match, we want to get each team's offensive
historical statistics as well as each team's defensive historical statistics. 
```{python register_secondary_datasets}
team_history_home_for = dr.Dataset.create_from_file("Data/team_gplus_xg_bygame_home.csv")
team_history_home_against = dr.Dataset.create_from_file("Data/team_gplus_xg_bygame_home.csv")
team_history_away_for = dr.Dataset.create_from_file("Data/team_gplus_xg_bygame_away.csv")
team_history_away_against = dr.Dataset.create_from_file("Data/team_gplus_xg_bygame_away.csv")
```

## Create feature lists for secondary datasets
```{python create_featurelists_secondary_datasets}
team_history_home_for_featurelist = team_history_home_for.create_featurelist(
  "Secondary model features", 
  ["Dribbling_Field", "Passing_Field", "Receiving_Field", "Shooting_Field", "Fouling_Field", "offensive_gplus", "team_xgoals", "Date"])

team_history_home_against_featurelist = team_history_home_against.create_featurelist(
  "Secondary model features", 
  ["Dribbling_Field", "Passing_Field", "Receiving_Field", "Shooting_Field", "Fouling_Field", "offensive_gplus", "team_xgoals", "Date"])
  
team_history_away_for_featurelist = team_history_away_for.create_featurelist(
  "Secondary model features", 
  ["Dribbling_Field", "Passing_Field", "Receiving_Field", "Shooting_Field", "Fouling_Field", "offensive_gplus", "team_xgoals", "Date"])  
  
team_history_away_against_featurelist = team_history_away_against.create_featurelist(
  "Secondary model features", 
  ["Dribbling_Field", "Passing_Field", "Receiving_Field", "Shooting_Field", "Fouling_Field", "offensive_gplus", "team_xgoals", "Date"])
```

## Prep the function to create projects
```{python project_setup_function}
def run_dr(months_ahead, home_indicator):
  
  # confirm that the project hasn't yet been made

```
## Kick off projects in parallel
Using the dask module, we queue and delay the function we wrote above to start project for combinations of months ahead and home vs. away. When each project has
been queued, we run them all with the compute() function.
```{python start_projects_in_parallel}
# queue projects
delayed_dr_projects = []
for months_ahead in [0,1,2,3]:
  for home_indicator in [0,1]:
    temp = delayed(run_dr)(months_ahead, home_indicator)
    delayed_dr_projects.append(temp)

# run projects in parallel
projects = compute(delayed_dr_projects)[0]

# filter to the projects that did not throw errors
projects_filtered = [project for project in projects if not isinstance(project, str)]

# wait for all autopilots to finish
for key in range(0,len(projects_filtered)):
    projects_filtered[key].wait_for_autopilot()
```
