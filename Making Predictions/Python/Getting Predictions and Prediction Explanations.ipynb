    "## Getting Predictions and Prediction Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Thodoris Petropoulos\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label**: Model Deployment\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of this notebook is to provide instructions on how to get predictions and prediction explanations out of a trained model using the Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The main ways you can get predictions out of DataRobot using Python would be the modeling API and the prediction API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling API**: You can use the modelling API if you use Python or R and there are multiple ways you can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction API**: Any project can be called with the Prediction API if you have prediction servers. This is a simple REST API. Click on a model in the UI, then \"Deploy Model\" and \"Activate now\". You'll have access to a Python code snippet to help you interact with it. You can also deploy the model through the python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we will focus on the Modeling API. Note that this particular method of scoring utilizes modeling workers. This means that if someone is using these workers for modeling, your prediction is going to have to wait. This method of scoring is good for testing but not for deployment. For actual deployment, please deploy the model as a REST API through DataRobot's UI or through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python version 3.7.3\n",
    "-  DataRobot API version 2.19.0. \n",
    "Small adjustments might be needed depending on the Python version and DataRobot API version you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full documentation of the Python package can be found here: https://datarobot-public-api-client.readthedocs-hosted.com\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed you already have a DataRobot <code>Project</code> object and a DataRobot <code>Model </code> object."

    "#### Time Series Projects Caveats\n",
    "Prediction datasets are uploaded as normal predictions. However, when uploading a prediction dataset, a new parameter forecastPoint can be specified. The forecast point of a prediction dataset identifies the point in time relative which predictions should be generated, and if one is not specified when uploading a dataset, the server will choose the most recent possible forecast point. The forecast window specified when setting the partitioning options for the project determines how far into the future from the forecast point predictions should be calculated.\n",
