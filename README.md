# API Samples for Data Scientists

This repository contains Python notebooks and R Markdown guides for achieving specific tasks using the API.

Start learning with the [API Training](https://github.com/datarobot-community/tutorials-for-data-scientists/tree/master/DRU/API_Training) module.

Additional code examples can be accessed from the following locations:

- [Tutorials for data scientists repo](https://github.com/datarobot-community/tutorials-for-data-scientists/)
- [AI Engineering repo](https://github.com/datarobot-community/ai_engineering)
- [docs.datarobot.com](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/code-examples/index.html)
- [R Vignettes included in the R client](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datarobot/index.html)
- [Examples included in the Python client](https://datarobot-public-api-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/v2.27.1/examples/index.html)

## Usage

For each respective guide, follow the instructions in its own `.ipynb` or `.Rmd` file. 

**Please pay attention to the different DataRobot API Endpoints**

The API endpoint you specify for accessing DataRobot is dependent on the deployment environment, as follows:

- AI Platform Trial—https://app2.datarobot.com/api/v2
- US Managed AI Cloud—https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2
- EU Managed AI Cloud—https://app.eu.datarobot.com/api/v2
- On-Premise—https://{datarobot.example.com}/api/v2 
       (replacing {datarobot.example.com} with your specific deployment endpoint
       
The DataRobot API Endpoint is used to connect your IDE to DataRobot.
